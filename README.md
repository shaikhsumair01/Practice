# Practice
A simple website design created by me. I took an inspiration from Omnifood project which I learned from Udemy and tried to create a design of my own with my own images and created a basic layout using some of the brand logos from google and used the omnifood logo since I didn't have a theme logo. Hope I don't get copywrite issues for using the logos.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚
Jk. I know that won't happen since this is a non profitable project and I have just uploaded it to show my creativity to the viewers.
Hope you like it.
Peace!

<!-- Steps for downloading the project in the systen for the viewers -->
Since the project is a simple model I have only created one subfolder/ Subdirectory for the project, which was for images.
.i.e The viewers will have to create only one main directory which is the "main project folder". In that they will have to create a sub directory called "images", which will have two folders "Desktop_logos" and "Mobile_logos" like how they are in the repo. Those folders will contain their respective images for desktop version as well as the mobile version. That's it for the images.

Coming to the coding part (Saving the coding file), the viewers will have to go out of the image folder (back to the main project folder). There they will simply have to create one html file named Test.html which will have the HTML code as it is. Then following the same procedure, they will have to create both the css files (test.css and Media.css) which will have their respective codes and finally test.js. Remember, all the coding files will be in the main directory itself and the project doesn't have any subdirectory for coding files.
