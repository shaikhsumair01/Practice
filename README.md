# Practice
This is a sample project made just to show my creativity to the viewers.
I took some inspiration from the Omnifood project I learned from a Udemy course and created my own basic responsive landing page.
Hope you like it.

<!-- Steps for downloading the project in the systen for the viewers -->
Since the project is a simple model I have only created one subfolder/ Subdirectory for the project inside the main directory, which was for images.
The subdirectory has 2 folders "mobile logo" and "desktop logo" for their respective images.
Note: Do not create sub directories for the cdoing files, the code will remain as it is in the root folder.
