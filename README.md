# Practice
This is a sample project made just to show my creativity to the viewers.
I took the inspiration from Omnifood project which I learned from a Udemy course and created my own design (a basic landing page for Omnifood) using some logos and images from the internet.
Hope you like it.

<!-- Steps for downloading the project in the systen for the viewers -->
Since the project is a simple model I have only created one subfolder/ Subdirectory for the project inside the main directory, which was for images.
The subdirectory has 2 folders "mobile logo" and "desktop logo".
